I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student at SJTU. I'm supervised by Professors [Guangtao Xue](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~xue-gt/) and [Yichao Chen](https://yichao0319.github.io/) from the MoSI Lab at the School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering (SEIEE). Before joining SJTU, I received my B.S. in Network Engineering from the School of Information and Communication Engineering at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). I'm currently conducting a research internship in the Alibaba Cloud and being advised by [Erci Xu](https://giorgioercixu.github.io/).

My research interests include computer networks and storage, with a focus on high-performance intra-datacenter network and user-space protocol.
